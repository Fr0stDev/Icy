## Icy Installer by WeAmDev

This is Icy, the one and only. Originally written by RipDev and picked up by WeAmDev afterwards. 

Icy was the best alternative to Cydia in it's time, but has long been rendered obsolete as new versions of iOS are being released, and Cydia being continuously updated by Jay Freeman (@saurik).

### This project is now dead, I no longer have time on my hands to maintain it. I think it is time for Icy Installer to finally die. Here is my reasoning:

* It has stopped working on iOS 5.1+ (This needs fixing, works on iOS 7 though?)
* The introduction of the Cydia Store (which Icy does not support)

## iOS 7

Yes. This supports iOS 7. You’re welcome.

## Compiling Icy Installer

You must set the correct permissions on Icy’s executable:

* chmod 4755 /Applications/Icy.app/Icy
* chown root:wheel /Applications/Icy.app/Icy
* chmod 755 /Applications/Icy.app/Trichlorotrifluoroethane
